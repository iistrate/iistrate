# Hey, I'm Ioan 👋

Founder & Principal Engineer at **[Tripvento](https://tripvento.com)** — a B2B API that ranks hotels by *traveler intent* using geospatial intelligence and semantic AI.

Instead of sorting by price or stars, Tripvento analyzes 200M+ spatial relationships to determine how a hotel's surroundings match what a traveler actually needs — whether that's a quiet business trip, a family vacation, or a romantic getaway. 212 destinations, 24K+ hotels, 14 traveler personas, sub-250ms response times.

## What I'm working on

- 🏨 Scaling Tripvento's programmatic SEO across hundreds of destinations
- 🤖 MCP server integration so AI travel agents can access structured hotel context
- 🎓 Head TA for Georgia Tech's Graduate Operating Systems course (~1,000 students)

## Background

- Worked on hotel ranking infrastructure at **U.S. News & World Report** serving 60M+ users
- MS Computer Science, **Georgia Tech**
- Full-stack: Python · Django · PostgreSQL/PostGIS · pgvector · REST APIs
- Previously ran a web dev agency (400+ client projects)

## Outside of code

Romanian-American splitting time between West Virginia, D.C., and Romania. Into weightlifting, boxing, hiking, and trying to get back to a sub-20 5K.
